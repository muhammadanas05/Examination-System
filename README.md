# Examination System

## Overview
This project is a Semester-end project of Object-Oriented Programming Language implemented in Java. It serves as an Examination System designed to assist instructors in managing course evaluations and facilitating students' participation in quizzes and assignments. The system offers a range of features, including question bank management, quiz generation, student registration, result preparation, and analytics generation, providing a comprehensive tool for conducting assessments and analyzing student performance.

## Features
- **User Management:** Allows the creation of instructor and student accounts for system access.
- **Question Bank Preparation:** Enables instructors to input multiple-choice, true/false, or subjective questions into the system.
- **Quiz Generation:** Facilitates the creation of quizzes by selecting questions from the question bank. Instructors can specify topics, number of questions, marks allocation, and set date/time for quizzes.
- **Quiz Conduct:** Allows registered students to attempt quizzes within the specified time frame. The system randomizes question sequences and answer options to enhance security.
- **Answer Key Generation:** Automatically generates answer keys/solutions for each quiz.
- **Result Preparation:** Computes and presents marks sheets for the entire class, storing them permanently.
- **Quiz Analytics:** Provides insights into quiz performance, including the percentage of correct answers for each question. Generates bar graphs to visualize question effectiveness.
- **Attendance Sheet Generation:** Generates attendance sheets marking absent students who did not attempt the quiz.
